     * Per the legacy student version of the code, the _chatBot destructor was getting called
     * every time a GraphNode was deleted. However, we know there is only 1 instance _chatBot 
     * which gets passed around from node to node. Therefore, it is incorrect to delete the 
     * _chatBot instance inside the destructor for graphNode (i.e. line above). The correct 
     * place is inside the chatLogic destructor (already there)
